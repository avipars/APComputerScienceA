******************************* P M R ********************************

<+s>: Using BlueJ was extremely simple, and quite handy via the color-coding.
     Java syntax is pretty straightforward, I am really liking it so far.
     

<-s>: All of the manual work took time, and sometimes a few simple errors confused
      me, but in the end I got it.
      I forgot how to make a variable show up in the statement, using concatenation.

In the future: It would probably work out much better if I finished this project
all at once, this time I took breaks every once in awhile and came back and forgot
what I was doing. I could also leave myself //comments, so that I know what I was
working on.
